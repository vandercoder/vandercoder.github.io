# Portfolio Website - Version 1

Usually to apply in most web development jobs you need to show a portfolio. It's 
not always required per se, but it's not a bad thing to have one. I was going to
build this website a little later since wanted to finish the entire Odin Project 
curriculum first. Plus I haven't really focused on front-end side of things, so 
I was a bit rusty on designing good-looking websites. But I wanted to apply to 
some jobs so I just jumped in and give it a go. 

I wrote this to recount my experience on building my first portfolio website and 
what I learned along the way.

### Spec
This websites implements basic HTML, CSS, and Javscript along with:
- Bulma
- Jquery

### Before starting
First thing I considered was which frameworks and libraries am I going to use?
Almost nobody I know builds their websites vanilla (HTML CSS JS ONLY), there's 
always some helper framework that could make your website prettier. 

For CSS frameworks, Bootstrap comes to mind. But I came across Bulma when I was 
learning RoR and find it very intuitive so I decided to use Bulma instead. 
This decision is partly because I thought Bulma simpler being a CSS only framework,
unlike Bootstrap which includes Javascript in its package. 

Afterwards comes the design. I wanted a modern looking sleek portfolio, so I checked
out good looking portfolio websites that didn't use too much javascript. Then 
I wrote a rough design on a piece of paper as a guide.

### Post Project Thoughts
- **Have a design ready in mind**. When I started building this website, I approached 
it the way I approached coding problems in general, by getting right into it. Because usually 
you can find the solution as you are working on the problem. But in terms of web
design, I find myself at loss doing this. How is it going to look like? Where am 
I going to put this and that? Because in terms of web design, it's more of a design problem 
not a logic one. So the key thing to remember is that you should have a rough idea 
on how the website should look like. If you have no idea, try looking at other 
websites on google and see how they look. Then grab a piece of paper 
and draw how each page would roughly look like. 

- **Prepare your content first**. Before you even start designing things, I find 
that you should have the content ready first. Sure you can design some layouts, 
but in the end you're going to have to test how that content looks like when it's actually
shown in the web. Does it fit with the other contents? Is the color OK? What about 
the size? These questions can only be answered after you actually put. So write 
down your bios and description first. Get the images you think could be a good 
fit for your website etc.. 

- **Design mobile first**. This turns out to be one of the tips given when starting
out on web design. Things tend to break in mobile size rather than the opposite.

- **Set a timeline**. As in all things, plan the project! This project ended up 
taking me around 7 days to finish. I find myself at loss of what to do next, or 
what content should I put. 

- **Not all features are equal** Some features make your website look much more modern. 
For instance, I find that there is a huge difference between using 
parallax and not using parallax on my backgrounds. This requires only a simple CSS 
manipulation but has more impact on how the website looks than the others. Other things 
I can think of are text shadows. They come in handy when you have text with low 
contrast. What I'm really trying to say is, invest your time on features that make 
an impact. Sometimes you could be working on something for a long time only to have
a lousy animation on your content. 

- **If you use images, optimize them first**. Compress them, use proper size. 

### Evaluation
- Side menu doesn't go well in mobile. 
- Background take too much time too load. 
- Center positioning are easier to be adapted to mobile screens
